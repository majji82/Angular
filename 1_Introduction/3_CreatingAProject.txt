Creating an Angular Project:

The Angular team created Angular CLI which is a tool which simplifies the process of creating Angular projects and also used behind the scene whenever we run the project in the server..

    We have to install it in order to create the project..

So in order to install angular, nodejs must be already installed in the local.. [nodejs.org]
npm install -g @angular/cli

Checking the version: ng --version

Creating a new Project:

ng new project-name
Ex: ng new my-first-project 

Naming convention:

=> No white spaces
=> better to use all lower case letters

Environment:

Any Code Editor => Preferably Visual studio Code
Extensions: Angular Language Service (angular.io), Angular Essentials (John Papa)

Running the project:
Open the terminal and go to the location where the project is located..and type "npm start"

Don't kill the terminal, as it automatically detects the changes and loads the website whenever we change the code..
