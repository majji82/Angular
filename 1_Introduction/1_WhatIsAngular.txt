What is Angular?

Angular is 
1. It is front-end Javascript framework [It is collection of packages and rules that helps to build advanced feature rich and highly interactive UI]
2. It is also collection of tools and features we can use [Ex: CLI, Code Editors, Debugging Tools, IDE Plugins]..

Why Angular?

Why a framework than plain JS?

For simple and trivial websites we don't need Angular. But, framework like Angular helps when the application becomes really complex..
    It simplifies the process of building complex, highly interactive web user Interfaces.


Four most important things why we use Angular?

1. We can write Declarative code..
With Vanilla JS we have to write step-by-step every single instruction that must be executed by the browser.[Imperative code]..
With Angular we write declarative code => we define the Target state [output] and also some markup (angular specific instructions) => and also define how they change... Angular do the rest of the job

    In simple words we define the target UI states and how they change..We don't have to manually change everything..

2. Separation of concerns via Components:
    When working with Angular we build a lot of components. [Custom HTML Elements].. We break complex user Interfaces into simpler parts..and compose them together again. This reduces the complexity of web user interfaces..

    => Reduce the complexity 
    => Simplify the development process by splitting the work among the team.
    => Build once and re-use multiple times

3. Some Object-Oriented programming concepts and principles.
    Dependency Injection, Classes => makes it easy to build complex web applications..

4. Use Typescript
    Angular uses TypeScript..
    TS is extension of JS => with strict and strong typing..
    This helps to detect errors in early stage during the development process.
