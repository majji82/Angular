Required and optional inputs:

@Input() avatar!: string;

If we observe this carefully we see that we are using ! mark saying typescript that we will definitely pass the value to the string avatar..But if we don't pass the value..It would be blank in the UI..
    To avoid this we have a properties required:true for the @Input() decorator..

@Input({required: true}) name!: string;
This will give error in the IDE if we really don't provide any value.
