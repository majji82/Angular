We have components which can be used multiple times by just calling their HTML tag multiple times...
But we can also define component inputs for them and can re-use..

1. Add the properties to the class which we want to set from outside..

Here now we need two strings which we need to set from outside which are avatar and name..
import { Input } from '@angular/core';

@Input() avatar!: string;
@Input() name!: string;

This @Input() decorator helps us to set the value from outside..but as we are using typescript we need to set the type and value of the variable..
    As we know that we set the value later we use the ! mark..to let ts no that the value will be set later..

Now we use multiple users in the app component by supplying names and avatar from outside..So first import it to the ts file..
    After importing we can use <app-user></app-user> tag as many users as we want and we supply the name and avatar 

Syntax:

<app-user [avatar]="users[0].avatar" [name]="users[0].name" /> 
Note: users is imported in the ts file..

Now coming to individual user in the app-user we can use either property binding or string interpolation..
We can use get method as we used earlier for computed values..
