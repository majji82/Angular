Input => Decorator
input => from signal...input() function

import {input} from '@angular/core'

avatar = input('default-value') 
The default value can be an empty string..We can also leave it without passing the default value..

avatar = input<string>(); [This is a typescript thing..called generic]
avatar = input.required<string>(); // Here we cannot pass an initial value..


Note: Input signals are read-only values...They cannot be set (i.e, even the set value doesn't work in the class)

Why input signals?

=> Efficiency [Angular updates only when the signal based value changes]..


Changes:

The input from signals must be called by braces...
Ex: avatar()

If it is set to another variable using computed..then that also called like a signal
imagePath = computed(()=> { return '/assets/users/' + this.avatar();});
<img src="imagePath()">
