Note: All the properties we are defining in the component class are available for the HTML file in the templateURL..

So we have array of objects in the dummy users... We can import the userComponent.ts file and we can use it with a variable name without let/var directly with the index..

Outputting the Dynamic component:

We have assigned a user to a variable in the ts..How to output it?
We have two main ways to output..

1. String Interpolation by using double curly braces..Ex: {{user.name}}
Syntax:
{{}}

In this way we can access anything which is present in the ts file into the html file..

2. Property Binding

We cannot use string interpolation in the image part because in the src attribute we have curly braces..
String interpolation method used to display dynamic output is generally used between the tags..

Syntax for property Binding:

Wrap square braces for the property.. and we can access the content directly in double quotes...
<img [src] = " 'assets/users/' + selectedUser.avatar ">  This is because it is a path..so we use a fixed string until the path and then the dynamic string for the picture..


As a good practice, we don't do computations in the html file...Instead, we do it using the get method..
get imagePath(){
    return 'assets/users/' + this.selectedUser.avatar
}

This is in the class..and this can be used in the html file by the name without calling the braces..
