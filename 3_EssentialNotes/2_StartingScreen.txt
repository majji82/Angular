=> When anyone visit the website the index.html in the src folder is the first file to load on the screen. But it is almost empty..

It only contains an app-root which is not a standard html element..  The first code to be executed when the application starts is in the main.ts file..
    But there are no script tags in the index.html file..But the script files are injected by the angular CLI and they are visible when we view page source..

This main.ts file imports AppComponent from app.component.ts.. This typescript file contains the AppComponent class which gets imported into the main.ts file..

What does the app.component.ts file contains?

=> It contains the class which needs to be imported to the main.ts 
=> It has a decorator above it which has meta-data [Component decorator]
    One of the main things in the component decorator is the selector
    selector: 'app-root' [This app-root we found in the first index.html file]..This html element is replaced by this component by looking in the selector..

    Apart from selector we have templateUrl and styleUrl which contains the HTML and CSS files for that particular Component..
